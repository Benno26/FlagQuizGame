The Flag Quiz Game app, testing the user's knowledge of the world's flags. 

Used the Utility Application template and UIViewController so that app could have a quiz game on the front side and game options on the flipside. 

On the FlipsideView, the user could select the regions included in the quiz and the number of answers to display. 

The quiz selected random flags and answers, and used a Segmented Control to display the answers.
